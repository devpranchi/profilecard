# Profile Card
A simple HTML/CSS profile card.

### Source Code?
It's in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/devpranchi/profilecard/tree/gh-pages) branch.

## Backstory
I created this as a practice tool for learning HTML and CSS. This happpened during a HTML/CSS workshop in a school on Singapore, they taught us how to create a simple HTML and CSS card. And now, I'm upgrading it a little bit, adding a slight touch and rework.

## Who am I?
I am Franz, 16 years old, living in the Philippines, and studying Senior High School - Tech Voc ICT in ACLC San Pedro. I am currently self learning JavaScript (preferably Node.js), HTML and CSS. I also make Discord bots! Elixir, a verified Discord bot, is part of my workspace, along with my currently working Frea bot.

I am living just a simple life, coding via a phone. It's my passion and *a girl* that keeps my dream alive— to be a Web Developer. Yeah.
